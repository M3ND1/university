ONCE UPON A TIME, MANY YEARS AGO WHEN OUR GRANDFATHERS WERE LITTLE
CHILDREN—THERE WAS A DOCTOR; AND HIS NAME WAS DOLITTLE—JOHN DOLITTLE,
M.D. "M.D." MEANS THAT HE WAS A PROPER DOCTOR AND KNEW A WHOLE LOT.
HE LIVED IN A LITTLE TOWN CALLED, PUDDLEBY-ON-THE-MARSH. ALL THE FOLKS,
YOUNG AND OLD, KNEW HIM WELL BY SIGHT. AND WHENEVER HE WALKED DOWN
THE STREET IN HIS HIGH HAT EVERYONE WOULD SAY, "THERE GOES THE DOCTOR!—
HE'S A CLEVER MAN." AND THE DOGS AND THE CHILDREN WOULD ALL RUN UP AND
FOLLOW BEHIND HIM; AND EVEN THE CROWS THAT LIVED IN THE CHURCH-TOWER
WOULD CAW AND NOD THEIR HEADS.
THE HOUSE HE LIVED IN, ON THE EDGE OF THE TOWN, WAS QUITE SMALL; BUT HIS
GARDEN WAS VERY LARGE AND HAD A WIDE LAWN AND STONE SEATS AND
WEEPING-WILLOWS HANGING OVER. HIS SISTER, SARAH DOLITTLE, WAS
HOUSEKEEPER FOR HIM; BUT THE DOCTOR LOOKED AFTER THE GARDEN HIMSELF.
HE WAS VERY FOND OF ANIMALS AND KEPT MANY KINDS OF PETS. BESIDES THE
GOLD-FISH IN THE POND AT THE BOTTOM OF HIS GARDEN, HE HAD RABBITS IN THE
PANTRY, WHITE MICE IN HIS PIANO, A SQUIRREL IN THE LINEN CLOSET AND A
HEDGEHOG IN THE CELLAR. HE HAD A COW WITH A CALF TOO, AND AN OLD LAME
HORSE-TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF AGE—AND CHICKENS, AND PIGEONS, AND TWO
LAMBS, AND MANY OTHER ANIMALS. BUT HIS FAVORITE PETS WERE DAB-DAB THE
DUCK, JIP THE DOG, GUB-GUB THE BABY PIG, POLYNESIA THE PARROT, AND THE
OWL TOO-TOO.
HIS SISTER USED TO GRUMBLE ABOUT ALL THESE ANIMALS AND SAID THEY MADE
THE HOUSE UNTIDY. AND ONE DAY WHEN AN OLD LADY WITH RHEUMATISM CAME
TO SEE THE DOCTOR, SHE SAT ON THE HEDGEHOG WHO WAS SLEEPING ON THE SOFA
AND NEVER CAME TO SEE HIM ANY MORE, BUT DROVE EVERY SATURDAY ALL THE
WAY TO OXENTHORPE, ANOTHER TOWN TEN MILES OFF, TO SEE A DIFFERENT DOCTOR.
THEN HIS SISTER, SARAH DOLITTLE, CAME TO HIM AND SAID,
"JOHN, HOW CAN YOU EXPECT SICK PEOPLE TO COME AND SEE YOU WHEN YOU
KEEP ALL THESE ANIMALS IN THE HOUSE? IT'S A FINE DOCTOR WOULD HAVE HIS
PARLOR FULL OF HEDGEHOGS AND MICE! THAT'S THE FOURTH PERSONAGE THESE
ANIMALS HAVE DRIVEN AWAY. SQUIRE JENKINS AND THE PARSON SAY THEY
WOULDN'T COME NEAR YOUR HOUSE AGAIN—NO MATTER HOW SICK THEY ARE. WE
ARE GETTING POORER EVERY DAY. IF YOU GO ON LIKE THIS, NONE OF THE BEST
PEOPLE WILL HAVE YOU FOR A DOCTOR."
"BUT I LIKE THE ANIMALS BETTER THAN THE 'BEST PEOPLE'," SAID THE DOCTOR.
"YOU ARE RIDICULOUS," SAID HIS SISTER, AND WALKED OUT OF THE ROOM.
SO, AS TIME WENT ON, THE DOCTOR GOT MORE AND MORE ANIMALS; AND THE
PEOPLE WHO CAME TO SEE HIM GOT LESS AND LESS. TILL AT LAST HE HAD NO ONE
LEFT—EXCEPT THE CAT'S-MEAT-MAN, WHO DIDN'T MIND ANY KIND OF ANIMALS.
BUT THE CAT'S-MEAT MAN WASN'T VERY RICH AND HE ONLY GOT SICK ONCE A
YEAR—AT CHRISTMAS-TIME, WHEN HE USED TO GIVE THE DOCTOR SIXPENCE FOR A
BOTTLE OF MEDICINE.
SIXPENCE A YEAR WASN'T ENOUGH TO LIVE ON—EVEN IN THOSE DAYS, LONG AGO;
AND IF THE DOCTOR HADN'T HAD SOME MONEY SAVED UP IN HIS MONEY-BOX, NO
ONE KNOWS WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.
AND HE KEPT ON GETTING STILL MORE PETS; AND OF COURSE IT COST A LOT TO FEED
THEM. AND THE MONEY HE HAD SAVED UP GREW LITTLER AND LITTLER.
THEN HE SOLD HIS PIANO, AND LET THE MICE LIVE IN A BUREAU-DRAWER. BUT THE
MONEY HE GOT FOR THAT TOO BEGAN TO GO, SO HE SOLD THE BROWN SUIT HE WORE
ON SUNDAYS AND WENT ON BECOMING POORER AND POORER.
AND NOW, WHEN HE WALKED DOWN THE STREET IN HIS HIGH HAT, PEOPLE
WOULD SAY TO ONE ANOTHER, "THERE GOES JOHN DOLITTLE, M.D.! THERE WAS A
TIME WHEN HE WAS THE BEST KNOWN DOCTOR IN THE WEST COUNTRY—LOOK AT
HIM NOW—HE HASN'T ANY MONEY AND HIS STOCKINGS ARE FULL OF HOLES!"
BUT THE DOGS AND THE CATS AND THE CHILDREN STILL RAN UP AND FOLLOWED HIM
THROUGH THE TOWN—THE SAME AS THEY HAD DONE WHEN HE WAS RICH.
THE SECOND CHAPTER
ANIMAL LANGUAGE
IT HAPPENED ONE DAY THAT THE DOCTOR WAS SITTING IN HIS KITCHEN TALKING
WITH THE CAT'S-MEAT-MAN WHO HAD COME TO SEE HIM WITH A STOMACH-ACHE.
"WHY DON'T YOU GIVE UP BEING A PEOPLE'S DOCTOR, AND BE AN ANIMALDOCTOR?" ASKED THE CAT'S-MEAT-MAN.
THE PARROT, POLYNESIA, WAS SITTING IN THE WINDOW LOOKING OUT AT THE RAIN
AND SINGING A SAILOR-SONG TO HERSELF. SHE STOPPED SINGING AND STARTED TO
LISTEN.
"YOU SEE, DOCTOR," THE CAT'S-MEAT-MAN WENT ON, "YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT
ANIMALS—MUCH MORE THAN WHAT THESE HERE VETS DO. THAT BOOK YOU
WROTE—ABOUT CATS, WHY, IT'S WONDERFUL! I CAN'T READ OR WRITE MYSELF—OR
MAYBE I'D WRITE SOME BOOKS. BUT MY WIFE, THEODOSIA, SHE'S A SCHOLAR,
SHE IS. AND SHE READ YOUR BOOK TO ME. WELL, IT'S WONDERFUL—THAT'S ALL CAN
BE SAID—WONDERFUL. YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN A CAT YOURSELF. YOU KNOW THE
WAY THEY THINK. AND LISTEN: YOU CAN MAKE A LOT OF MONEY DOCTORING
ANIMALS. DO YOU KNOW THAT? YOU SEE, I'D SEND ALL THE OLD WOMEN WHO
HAD SICK CATS OR DOGS TO YOU. AND IF THEY DIDN'T GET SICK FAST ENOUGH, I
COULD PUT SOMETHING IN THE MEAT I SELL 'EM TO MAKE 'EM SICK, SEE?"
"OH, NO," SAID THE DOCTOR QUICKLY. "YOU MUSTN'T DO THAT. THAT WOULDN'T
BE RIGHT."
"OH, I DIDN'T MEAN REAL SICK," ANSWERED THE CAT'S-MEAT-MAN. "JUST A LITTLE
SOMETHING TO MAKE THEM DROOPY-LIKE WAS WHAT I HAD REFERENCE TO. BUT AS
YOU SAY, MAYBE IT AIN'T QUITE FAIR ON THE ANIMALS. BUT THEY'LL GET SICK
ANYWAY, BECAUSE THE OLD WOMEN ALWAYS GIVE 'EM TOO MUCH TO EAT. AND
LOOK, ALL THE FARMERS 'ROUND ABOUT WHO HAD LAME HORSES AND WEAK
LAMBS—THEY'D COME. BE AN ANIMAL-DOCTOR."
WHEN THE CAT'S-MEAT-MAN HAD GONE THE PARROT FLEW OFF THE WINDOW ON
TO THE DOCTOR'S TABLE AND SAID,
"THAT MAN'S GOT SENSE. THAT'S WHAT YOU OUGHT TO DO. BE AN ANIMAL-DOCTOR.
GIVE THE SILLY PEOPLE UP—IF THEY HAVEN'T BRAINS ENOUGH TO SEE YOU'RE THE
BEST DOCTOR IN THE WORLD. TAKE CARE OF ANIMALS INSTEAD—THEY'LL SOON
FIND IT OUT. BE AN ANIMAL-DOCTOR."
"OH, THERE ARE PLENTY OF ANIMAL-DOCTORS," SAID JOHN DOLITTLE, PUTTING THE
FLOWER-POTS OUTSIDE ON THE WINDOW-SILL TO GET THE RAIN.
"YES, THERE ARE PLENTY," SAID POLYNESIA. "BUT NONE OF THEM ARE ANY GOOD
AT ALL. NOW LISTEN, DOCTOR, AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING. DID YOU KNOW THAT
ANIMALS CAN TALK?"
"I KNEW THAT PARROTS CAN TALK," SAID THE DOCTOR.
"OH, WE PARROTS CAN TALK IN TWO LANGUAGES—PEOPLE'S LANGUAGE AND BIRDLANGUAGE," SAID POLYNESIA PROUDLY. "IF I SAY, 'POLLY WANTS A CRACKER,' YOU
UNDERSTAND ME. BUT HEAR THIS: KA-KA OI-EE, FEE-FEE?"
"GOOD GRACIOUS!" CRIED THE DOCTOR. "WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?"
"THAT MEANS, 'IS THE PORRIDGE HOT YET?'—IN BIRD-LANGUAGE."
"MY! YOU DON'T SAY SO!" SAID THE DOCTOR. "YOU NEVER TALKED THAT WAY TO
ME BEFORE."
"WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE GOOD?" SAID POLYNESIA, DUSTING SOME
CRACKER-CRUMBS OFF HER LEFT WING. "YOU WOULDN'T HAVE UNDERSTOOD ME IF I
HAD."
"TELL ME SOME MORE," SAID THE DOCTOR, ALL EXCITED; AND HE RUSHED OVER TO
THE DRESSER-DRAWER AND CAME BACK WITH THE BUTCHER'S BOOK AND A PENCIL.
"NOW DON'T GO TOO FAST—AND I'LL WRITE IT DOWN. THIS IS INTERESTING—VERY
INTERESTING—SOMETHING QUITE NEW. GIVE ME THE BIRDS' A.B.C. FIRST—
SLOWLY NOW."
SO THAT WAS THE WAY THE DOCTOR CAME TO KNOW THAT ANIMALS HAD A
LANGUAGE OF THEIR OWN AND COULD TALK TO ONE ANOTHER. AND ALL THAT
AFTERNOON, WHILE IT WAS RAINING, POLYNESIA SAT ON THE KITCHEN TABLE GIVING
HIM BIRD WORDS TO PUT DOWN IN THE BOOK.
AT TEA-TIME, WHEN THE DOG, JIP, CAME IN, THE PARROT SAID TO THE DOCTOR,
"SEE, HE'S TALKING TO YOU."
"LOOKS TO ME AS THOUGH HE WERE SCRATCHING HIS EAR," SAID THE DOCTOR.
"BUT ANIMALS DON'T ALWAYS SPEAK WITH THEIR MOUTHS," SAID THE PARROT IN A
HIGH VOICE, RAISING HER EYEBROWS. "THEY TALK WITH THEIR EARS, WITH THEIR
FEET, WITH THEIR TAILS—WITH EVERYTHING. SOMETIMES THEY DON'T WANT TO
MAKE A NOISE. DO YOU SEE NOW THE WAY HE'S TWITCHING UP ONE SIDE OF HIS
NOSE?"
"WHAT'S THAT MEAN?" ASKED THE DOCTOR.
"THAT MEANS, 'CAN'T YOU SEE THAT IT HAS STOPPED RAINING?'" POLYNESIA
ANSWERED. "HE IS ASKING YOU A QUESTION. DOGS NEARLY ALWAYS USE THEIR
NOSES FOR ASKING QUESTIONS."
AFTER A WHILE, WITH THE PARROT'S HELP, THE DOCTOR GOT TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE
OF THE ANIMALS SO WELL THAT HE COULD TALK TO THEM HIMSELF AND UNDERSTAND
EVERYTHING THEY SAID. THEN HE GAVE UP BEING A PEOPLE'S DOCTOR
ALTOGETHER.
AS SOON AS THE CAT'S-MEAT-MAN HAD TOLD EVERY ONE THAT JOHN DOLITTLE WAS
GOING TO BECOME AN ANIMAL-DOCTOR, OLD LADIES BEGAN TO BRING HIM THEIR
PET PUGS AND POODLES WHO HAD EATEN TOO MUCH CAKE; AND FARMERS CAME
MANY MILES TO SHOW HIM SICK COWS AND SHEEP.
ONE DAY A PLOW-HORSE WAS BROUGHT TO HIM; AND THE POOR THING WAS
TERRIBLY GLAD TO FIND A MAN WHO COULD TALK IN HORSE-LANGUAGE.
"YOU KNOW, DOCTOR," SAID THE HORSE, "THAT VET OVER THE HILL KNOWS NOTHING
AT ALL. HE HAS BEEN TREATING ME SIX WEEKS NOW—FOR SPAVINS. WHAT I NEED
IS SPECTACLES. I AM GOING BLIND IN ONE EYE. THERE'S NO REASON WHY
HORSES SHOULDN'T WEAR GLASSES, THE SAME AS PEOPLE. BUT THAT STUPID MAN
OVER THE HILL NEVER EVEN LOOKED AT MY EYES. HE KEPT ON GIVING ME BIG
PILLS. I TRIED TO TELL HIM; BUT HE COULDN'T UNDERSTAND A WORD OF HORSELANGUAGE. WHAT I NEED IS SPECTACLES."
t is quite pleasant, my little friend, to have to write a chapter for you, where I can tell you of all things going well for England, that dear country where God allows us to live, which he has given us to love, and to do all we can for.

When first Elizabeth became queen, her counsellors and the Parliament, and the people, all asked her to marry, and promised to receive kindly anybody she should choose. And the King of Spain asked her to marry him, but she told him she would not marry him, because he had been her sister’s husband; and she did not believe the Pope had power to allow her to marry one who had been her sister’s husband. Then the old Queen of France, Catherine of Medicis, who had taught poor Mary Queen of Scots to be so foolish and cruel, wanted Queen Elizabeth to marry one of her sons. But Elizabeth did not like them any better than she did Philip, yet more than once she pretended she was going to marry one of them, for she wanted to be friends with France, and so make England strong and able to fight successfully against Spain. Then some of[Pg 178] the great English lords wanted to marry her. But she knew that if she married one of them the others would be jealous, and, may be, would make a civil war in England; so she thanked the counsellors, and the Parliament, and the people, for their kindness, but said she would rather live single, as she had quite enough to do to govern the kingdom well, without being troubled with marrying. And she kept her word, and never married, and is always called the Maiden Queen.

I told you long ago, that the first great sea-fight in which the English beat the French was in the reign of Edward the Third. Since that time the English ships had been very much improved; instead of only one mast, the largest had three, and instead of stones for the sailors to throw at one another, there were large and small guns to fight with. Then the sailors were as much improved as the ships. Instead of only sailing along by the land, and only going to sea in good weather, they made long voyages.

You know, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth’s grandfather, I told you that some bold sailors had sailed as far as America. Now Queen Elizabeth, who knew very well that the kings of France and Spain wanted to make war upon England, and drive her away, and oppress the Protestants, thought, like wise King Alfred, that the best way to defend England was to have plenty of ships and good seamen, and brave admirals and captains to command them: and so meet her enemies on the sea, and keep them from ever landing in England.

I must tell you something about one or two of Queen Elizabeth’s great admirals.

Sir Francis Drake, the first man who ever sailed[Pg 179] his ship round the whole world, was born in Devonshire, and went to sea at first with some other brave gentlemen, to carry on a war against some towns which the Spaniards had built in South America. This was very wrong, because private persons have no business to make war, and take towns, and make prisoners of the townspeople. Such things should only be done when there is a lawful war between two countries. Then, indeed, every man must do his duty, and fight as well as he can for his own country and king. If private gentlemen were to go and take towns belonging to other countries, now, they would be called pirates, and they would be hanged.

However, as Sir Francis Drake grew older, he left off making private war, became one of the queen’s best admirals, and you will read more about him near the end of this chapter.

When he made his grand voyage round the world, he sailed always from the East to the West. He first went round Cape Horn, at the very South end of South America, where he saw great islands of ice as high as a large hill, and penguins and albatrosses swimming about them. Then he sailed to the Spice Islands, where he saw cloves and nutmegs grow, and birds of Paradise flying about in the air, and peacocks in the fields, and monkeys skipping from tree to tree in the woods. Then he passed by the Cape of Good Hope, which is in the South part of Africa, where all the beautiful geraniums and heaths come from.

Queen Elizabeth spoke to him kindly when he set out, and when he came back, after being three years at sea, she went and dined with him on board his own ship, and saw all the beautiful and curious things he had brought home with him.

[Pg 180]

Another great Admiral was Sir Martin Frobisher, who had been to the furthest parts of North America, and first saw all the land about Hudson’s Bay, and those countries to the south of that bay, where the English not long afterwards built towns, and settled a great many free states, that you will read a great deal about some day.

In many things, the next admiral I will tell you about was a greater man than any of the rest. His name was Sir Walter Raleigh; he was both a sailor and a soldier: sometimes he commanded a ship, and sometimes he fought along with the army on shore.

The first time the queen took notice of him was one day that she was walking in London, and came to a splashy place just as Sir Walter was going by. As she was thinking how she could best step through the mud, Sir Walter took off a nice new cloak that he had on, and spread it on the dirt, so that the queen might walk over without wetting her shoes. She was very much pleased, and desired him to go to see her at her palace; and as she found that he was very clever and very brave, she made him one of her chief admirals.

Queen Elizabeth used to behave to her brave admirals and generals, and her wise counsellors, and even to her great merchants, like a friend. She visited them in their houses, and talked to them cheerfully of her affairs. She took notice of even the poorest people, and she used to walk and ride about, so that all her subjects knew her and loved her. And now I am going to tell you a part of her history, which will show you how happy it was for her and for England that the people did love their good queen.

The King of Spain had never loved Elizabeth; and[Pg 181] he hated England, because the people were Protestants: and I am sure you remember how cruel he and his wife Queen Mary were to the English.

He made war against England, and thought that if he could land a great army on the coast, he might conquer all the country and drive away Elizabeth, and make the English all Papists again. He hoped this would be easy, because he was the richest king in the world, and had more ships and sailors and soldiers than any other. And he began to build more ships and to collect more sailors and soldiers; and he made so sure he should conquer England, that I have heard he even had chains put on board the ships, to chain the English admirals when his people should take them.

This fleet, that King Philip made ready to conquer England, was the largest that any king had ever sent to sea, and he called it the “Invincible Armada,”[3] because, he said, nobody could conquer it.

But Queen Elizabeth heard in time that Philip was making ready this great navy, to bring as great an army to attack England. She immediately told the Parliament and people of her danger. She rode out herself to see her soldiers and her ships, and she said she trusted herself entirely to her good people. The people soon showed her they might be trusted: they came willingly to be sailors and soldiers; and the great lords gave money to pay the soldiers; and many gentlemen built ships, and bought guns, and gave them to the queen. And she had soon a good fleet. It was not so large as King Philip’s indeed, and the ships were quite small compared with his; but the sailors belonging to it remembered that they were to fight for their own dear England, and for a queen whom they loved.

It is a long time since I mentioned Ireland to you. You know that in the reign of King Henry the Second the English took a great part of it, and drove the old Irish away to the west side of the island.

Now the English, who settled in Ireland at that time, soon grew more like Irish than Englishmen, and they were as ready to quarrel with any new English that went to settle there as the old Irish had been to quarrel with them; so poor Ireland had never been quiet. The different lords of the new Irish, and the kings of the old were always fighting, and then they sent to England sometimes to ask for help, and often to complain of one another. Then the kings of England used to send soldiers, with private captains, who very often fought whoever they met, instead of helping one side or the other; and these soldiers generally treated the unhappy Irish as ill as the Danes used to treat the English.

In Queen Elizabeth’s time the miserable people in Ireland were never a day without some sad quarrel or fight in which many of them were killed; and though Ireland is a good country for corn and cattle, and all things useful, yet there was nothing to be had there but oatmeal; the people lived like wild savages, and even a good many of the English that had settled there wore the coarse Irish dress, used bows and arrows, and let their hair grow filthy and[Pg 186] matted, more like the wild old Britons you read of in the first chapter, than like Christian gentlemen.

Ireland was strangely divided then; there was the part where the old Irish lived in huts among bogs and mountains; then the part with a few old castles that the first English settlers had built; and then that where fresh captains, who had come from time to time, had fixed themselves in forts and towns; and all these three parts were constantly at war.

Elizabeth, when she found how very ill Ireland was governed, wished to make it a little more like England, and to try to bring the people to live in peace. She sent a wise Governor there, called Sir Henry Sydney, and then another called Arthur Lord Grey de Wilton; but all that these good men could do was to keep the new English a little in order, and to try to do justice to the other people. By the queen’s orders they set up schools, and a college in Dublin, in hopes that the young Irishmen would learn to become more like the men of other countries.

But the bad way of governing Ireland had gone on too long to allow it to be changed all at once; and Elizabeth found she must send an army there to keep the different English and Irish chiefs in order, if she wished to have peace in the country.

Now these chiefs were all Roman Catholics, for I believe there were no Protestants in Ireland but the very newest of the English; and when the King of Spain made war against Queen Elizabeth, he sent some Spanish soldiers to Ireland to help the Irish chiefs to make war upon the English.

The story of these wars is long and very sad, and belongs rightly to the history of Ireland; but I must tell you what happened to one or two of the chief men of Ireland at this time.

[Pg 187]

The Earl of Desmond was one who joined the King of Spain’s people, and when Lord Grey drove the Spaniards out of Ireland, Desmond tried to hide himself among the woods and bogs in the wildest part of the country. But the English soldiers hunted him from place to place, so that he had no rest. One night he and his wife had just gone to bed in a house close by the side of a river; the English soldiers came, and the old Lord and Lady Desmond had just time to get up and run into the water, in which they stood up to their necks, till the English were gone. At last some soldiers, who were seeking for them, saw a very old man sitting by himself in a poor hut; they found out it was the Earl of Desmond, and they cut off his head directly, and sent it to queen Elizabeth.

But the most famous Irishman at this time was Hugh O’Neil, Earl of Tyrone. His uncle, Shane O’Neil, tried to make himself King of Ulster, and hated the English so that he killed some of his own family because they wanted to teach the Irish to eat bread like the English, instead of oat cakes.

This Hugh, Earl of Tyrone, had a large army of Irish, and fought all the queen’s officers for many years, though she sent many of the best and bravest there. Sir Henry Bagenal was one, and her greatest favourite, the Earl of Essex, was another. Two or three times, when Tyrone was near being conquered, he pretended to submit, and promised that if the queen would forgive him, he would keep his Irish friends quiet. He broke his word, however, and kept a civil war up in Ireland till very near the queen’s death, when, after being almost starved for want of food in the bogs near his own home, he made peace in earnest, and Ireland was quiet for a few years.

[Pg 188]

We are come now to the end of Queen Elizabeth’s long and famous reign. She died when she had been queen forty-five years, and was very unhappy at her death. Her favourite Lord Essex behaved so ill after he came from Ireland, that the queen’s counsellors ordered him to be put to death. Now, the queen had once given him a ring, when he was her greatest favourite, and told him, that if he would send it to her whenever he was in danger, she would save his life and forgive any of his faults. She thought he would send this ring to her, when he knew he was condemned to have his head cut off; and so he did; but a cruel woman to whom he trusted it, to give the queen, never did so till long after Essex was dead; and then Elizabeth, who was old and ill herself, was so vexed, that she hardly ever spoke to anybody again, and died in a few days afterwards at Richmond.

It would make our little history too long, if I tried to tell you of all the wise and good things done by Elizabeth, or if I told you the names of half the famous men who lived in her time.

Besides Essex, there was her other favourite, Leicester, a clever bad man.

Her god-son, Harrington, belonged to the learned men and poets of her time; but neither he nor any of the rest, though there were many, were to be compared to Shakespeare, whose plays everybody reads and loves, nor even to Spenser, who lived and died in Elizabeth’s reign.

Then there were her wise counsellors Sir Nicholas Bacon, Lord Burleigh, and Walsingham, and, all the generals and admirals I have told you about. I must just mention one more, because you will wish to be like him when you grow up. He was Sir[Pg 189] Philip Sidney, the best and wisest, and most learned, and bravest. He was killed in battle. When he was lying on the ground, very hot and thirsty, and bleeding to death, a friend was bringing him a cup of water; but he happened to look round, and saw a poor dying soldier who had no friends near him, looking eagerly towards the cup. Sir Philip did not touch it, but sent to be given to that soldier, who blessed him as he was dying. And that act of self-denial and mercy makes all who hear the name of Philip Sidney bless him even now.

ames Stuart, the first King James of England, but the sixth of Scotland, was one of the most foolish and the most mischievous kings we ever had in England. He was the son of the unhappy Mary Queen of Scots, and after she was put in prison the first time, the Scotch lords made James king, though he was quite an infant. The lords gave him the best masters they could find to teach him, and he learned what was in books very well, but nobody could ever teach him how to behave wisely.

When Queen Elizabeth died, James, king of Scotland, became king of England, because he was Elizabeth’s cousin, and from that time England and[Pg 190] Scotland have been under one king, and are called Great Britain.

As soon as James heard the queen was dead, he set out from Scotland to come to London; for as Scotland was then a very poor country, he and a great number of Scotchmen who came with him thought they had nothing to do but to come to England, and get all the money they could by all sorts of ways. Then he made so many lords and knights that people began to laugh at him and his new nobles. But, worst of all, he fancied that parliaments had no business to prevent kings from doing whatever they pleased, and taking money from their subjects whenever they liked.

You may think how vexed the English were when they found that they had a king so unfit for them, after their wise Queen Elizabeth.

The queen of James was Anne, the daughter of the King of Denmark. She was very extravagant, and loved feasts and balls, and acted plays herself, and filled the court with rioting, instead of the ladylike music and dancing, and poetry and needlework, that Queen Elizabeth and her ladies loved.

Instead of riding about among the people, and depending on their love and good will, James was always hiding himself; the only thing he seemed to love was hunting, and for the sake of that he neglected his people and his business.

The favourites he had were far from being useful, or wise, or brave. He chose them for their good looks and rosy cheeks, without inquiring anything about their behaviour.

He dealt severely with the Roman Catholics, whom he put in prison, and from whom he took a great deal of money. Then he disliked those Protestants[Pg 191] who did not wish to have bishops as well as parish clergymen, and who are mostly called Presbyterians; but some were then named Puritans, and he would not let them alter the Prayer-book.

The Roman Catholics being tired of the ill usage they got from King James, some of them thought that, if they could kill him, they might take one of his young children to bring up themselves, and have a Roman Catholic king or queen, and get all England and Scotland for themselves. They thought besides, that they had better kill all the lords and all the gentlemen of the House of Commons too, and so get rid of the whole Protestant parliament.

From thinking wickedly they went on to do wickedly. They found there were some cellars under the houses of parliament, and they filled these cellars with gunpowder; and as they expected the parliament would meet in the house all together, with the king, on the fifth day of November, they hired a man called Guy Fawkes to set fire to the gunpowder, and so to blow it up, and kill everybody there at once.

Now, it happened that one of the lords, whose name was Mounteagle, had a friend among the Roman Catholics, and that friend wrote him a letter, without signing his name, to beg him not to go to the parliament that day, for that a sudden blow would be struck which would destroy them all. Lord Mounteagle took this letter to the king’s council. Some of the councillors laughed at it, and said it was only sent to frighten Lord Mounteagle. But the king took it, and after thinking a little, he said, the sudden blow must mean something to be done with gunpowder, and he set people to watch who went in and out of the vaults under the parliament-house;[Pg 192] till at last, on the very night before the Roman Catholics hoped to kill the king and all those belonging to parliament, they caught Guy Fawkes with his dark lantern, waiting till the time should come for him to set fire to the gunpowder.

The king was very proud of having found out what the letter meant, and used to boast of it as long as he lived; but the truth is that the king’s clever minister, Sir Robert Cecil, had found out all about the plot, and managed to let James have all the credit.

So far I have only told you of the foolish behaviour of King James. I must now write about his mischievous actions.

His eldest son, Prince Henry, died very young; he was a sensible lad, and the people were sorry when he died, especially as his brother Charles was a sickly little boy.

Now, little Charles was a clever child, and had very good dispositions; and if he had been properly brought up, he would have been a good king, and a happy man. Instead of that, you will read that he was a bad king, and I daresay you will cry when you find how very unhappy he was at last.

James taught him that no power on earth had any right to find fault with the king, that the king’s power was given to him by God, and that it was a great sin to say that anything the king did was wrong. Thus he taught him to think that the people were made for nothing but to obey kings, and to labour and get money for kings to spend as they pleased, and that even the nobles were nothing but servants for kings; in short, he filled his poor little son’s mind with wrong thoughts, and never taught him that it was a king’s duty to do all the good he could, and to set an example of what is right.

[Pg 193]

Yet Charles had many good qualities, as you will read by-and-by. He was a good scholar, and loved books and clever men, and music, and pictures; and if he had only been taught his duty as a king properly, he would have done a great deal of good to England.
I have told you that James used to make favourites of people, without caring much about their[Pg 194] goodness. One of his greatest favourites was George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, and he gave his son Charles to the Duke to take care of, just when he was grown up. The silly king used to call Buckingham, Steenie, and the prince, Baby Charles, although he was almost as big and as old as a man.

When the prince was old enough to be married, his father wished him to marry the Infanta of Spain. (In Spain the princes are called Infants, and the princesses Infantas.) Now the Duke of Buckingham wanted very much to go abroad, and show himself to all the princes and nobles in France and Spain, for he was very vain of his beauty and his fine clothes; so he put it into the prince’s head, to tell his father he would not marry, unless he would let him go to Spain with the Duke of Buckingham, and see the Infanta before he married her.

The poor foolish king began crying like a child, and begged his dear Steenie and Baby Charles not to go and leave him; but they laughed at him, and went and borrowed all his fine diamonds and pearls, to wear in their hats and round their necks, and took all the money they could get, and set off to go to Spain. They called themselves John Smith and Thomas Smith, and first they went to France.

Prince Charles found the ladies in the French court very pleasant and entertaining. It is true that several of them were not very good, but then they amused Charles, and he was particularly pleased with the Princess Henrietta Maria, who was pretty and merry, and appeared to like Charles very much.

They quickly pursued their journey through France to go to Spain, and when Charles and Buckingham first got there everything seemed very pleasant. The Infanta was handsome, but very different from[Pg 195] Henrietta Maria, for she was very grave and steady, and seemed as if she would be a fit wife for the prince, who was naturally grave and steady too.

But the Duke of Buckingham quarrelled with some of the great men of the court, and was so much affronted at not being treated rather like a king than only a plain English nobleman, that he made the prince believe that the King of Spain meant to offend him, and did not really intend his daughter to marry him; and, in short, he contrived to make Charles so angry, that he left Spain in a rage, and afterwards married that very French princess, Henrietta Maria, whom he had seen at Paris.

The bad education King James gave his son Charles, though it was the most mischievous of all his bad acts, was not the only one.

The King of Spain had taken a dislike to Sir Walter Raleigh, who had been so great a favourite of Queen Elizabeth, because Raleigh had beaten his sailors at sea, and his soldiers ashore. But Sir Walter’s men happened to kill some Spaniards when they were looking for a gold mine in South America; so the King of Spain demanded that James should put Raleigh to death, and James shamefully yielded to Spain, and ordered that great and wise man’s head to be cut off.

As to Scotland, King James’s own country, he behaved as ill in all things belonging to it as he did in England. But the thing that turned out worst for the country and his poor son Charles was his insisting on the Scotch people kneeling at the communion, keeping certain holy days, and having bishops, although the Scotch religion is presbyterian. This vexed the Scotch people very much indeed. And the Irish were not better pleased, because the[Pg 196] Roman Catholics were ill-treated by James, and most of the Irish were Roman Catholics.

When James died, all the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland were discontented. Poor Ireland was even worse off than ever. Scotland had been neglected, and the people affronted about their religion; and, in England, James had taken money unlawfully, and behaved so ill, both to parliament and people, that everybody disliked him as a king, and he was so silly in his private behaviour, that everybody laughed at him as a gentleman.

In short, I can praise him for nothing but a little book-learning; but as he made no good use of it, he might as well have been without it. He reigned twenty-two years in England, during which there was no great war. But James had begun one against the Emperor of Germany and the King of Spain, just before his death.

I must tell you of one very great man who lived in his reign: Lord Bacon. He was one of the wisest men that ever lived, though not without his faults; but when you grow up you will read his books if you

When Charles the First came to be king, all the people were in hopes that he would be a better king than his father, as they believed he was a better man, and so he really was.

[Pg 197]

He was young and pleasant-looking; he was fond of learning, and seemed inclined to show kindness to all clever men, whether they were poets or good writers in any way, or musicians, or painters, or architects.

Besides, the people hoped that he would manage his money better than James, and not waste it in clothes, and jewels, and drinking, and hunting, and giving it to favourites.

But, unhappily, Charles still allowed the Duke of Buckingham to advise him in everything; indeed, he was a greater favourite than before James’s death, for he had managed to get the French princess Henrietta Maria for a wife for Charles, who was so fond of her, that he thought he never could thank Buckingham enough for bringing her to England.

But the parliament, particularly the Commons, did not like the marriage so much. The new queen was a Roman Catholic, and she brought a number of Roman Catholic ladies and priests to be her servants, and she soon showed that she was greedy and extravagant.

Charles, who, as I told you, had been very badly taught by his father, desired the parliament to give him money in a very haughty manner. The parliament said the people should pay some taxes, but that they could not afford a great deal at that time, for James had been so extravagant that they had not much left to give. Charles, by the advice of Buckingham, sent away the parliament, and tried to get money without its leave, and sent officers about the country to beg for money in the king’s name. Most people were afraid to refuse, and so Charles and Buckingham got a good deal to do as they pleased with.

[Pg 198]

Buckingham persuaded King Charles to make war against France, because one of the great men in France had affronted him. King James had begun a war with Spain.

The people were now more and more angry, for though they might like to fight for the glory of England, or for the good of the king, they could not bear to think of fighting for a proud, cruel, and selfish man like Buckingham.

I do not know what might have happened at that very time, perhaps a civil war, if a desperate man named Felton had not killed the Duke of Buckingham at Portsmouth, when he was on the way to France to renew the war.

The people were again in hopes that the king would do what was right, and consult the parliament before he attempted to make war, or take money for his subjects, or put any man in prison, now that his bad adviser, Buckingham, was dead. But they were much mistaken. Charles found new advisers, and governed for eleven years without a parliament. The king wanted money, and tried to compel all who had land to pay a tax called Ship Money; but some gentlemen, one of whom was Mr. John Hampden, refused to pay it, and said it was unlawful for the king to take money without the consent of parliament. But the judges declared that the king could take Ship Money, and that the people must pay it. Two of them, however, felt compelled to say that Charles had broken the laws, and the promises made by the English kings in agreement with the Great Charter.

This made the people very angry. They said the worst times were come again, when the kings fancied they might rob their subjects, and put them in prison when they pleased.

[Pg 199]

Charles was a very affectionate man, and he could not help loving and trusting others instead of making use of his own sense and trusting his people, as Queen Elizabeth had done. So he allowed the queen to advise him in most things, and Laud, Bishop of London, in others; particularly in matters of religion. So he began to oppress the Puritans in England. In poor Ireland, a harsh man, the Earl of Strafford, a great friend and favourite of King Charles, governed in such a cruel manner that everybody complained.

He sent English clergymen to preach in those parts of Ireland where the poor people could only understand Irish, and punished the people for not listening: and when some of the bishops (particularly good Bishop Bedel) begged him to have mercy upon the Irish, he threatened to punish them most severely for speaking in their favour.

All this time the king and queen and their friends were going on taking money by unlawful means from the people, till he was obliged to call a parliament. Then the gentlemen of the Commons insisted on Lord Strafford and Archbishop Laud being punished. Indeed, they would not be satisfied until Charles consented that Strafford’s head should be cut off.

Now, though Strafford well deserved some punishment, he had done nothing which by law deserved death; and therefore Charles ought to have refused his consent. The king had often quarrelled with the parliament, and acted contrary to its advice when he was in the wrong; but now that it would have been right to resist he gave way, and Strafford, who loved Charles, and whose very faults were owing to the king’s own wishes and commands, was beheaded by his order.

Abook twice as big as our little History would not hold all the story of the Civil Wars. England, Scotland, and Ireland were all engaged in them; and many dreadful battles were fought, where Englishmen killed one another, and a great deal of blood was shed.

The first great battle was fought at Edgehill, where many of the king’s officers were killed: then, at a less fight at Chalgrove, the parliament lost that great and good man Mr. Hampden. The battles of Newbury, of Marston Moor, and of Naseby, are all sadly famous for the number of brave and good Englishmen that were killed.

During this civil war, the parliament sent often to the king, in hopes of persuading him to make peace: and I believe that the parliament, and the king, and the real English lords and gentlemen on both sides, truly desired to have peace, and several times the king had promised the parliament to do what they lawfully might ask of him.

But, unhappily, the queen had come back to England, and the king trusted her and took her advice, when he had much better have followed his own good thoughts. Now, the queen and Prince Rupert, the king’s nephew, and some of the lords,[Pg 203] were of James the First’s way of thinking, and would not allow that subjects had any right even to their own lives, or lands, or money, if the king chose to take them: and so they persuaded the king to break his word so often with the people and parliament, that at last they could not trust him any longer.

When the king found that the parliament would not trust him again, he determined to go to the Scottish army that had come to England to help the parliament, and he hoped that the Scots would take his part and defend him. But he had offended the Scots by meddling more than they liked with their religion, and some other things, and the leaders of their army agreed to give him up to the English parliament. You will hardly believe, however, that those mean Scots actually sold the king to the English parliament: but they did so. The unhappy king was sent back to England, and was now obliged to agree to what the parliament wished, and there seemed to be an end of the Civil War.

It was not long, however, before it began again; and this second time it ended in Cromwell and the other generals of the army becoming the most powerful men in England. These men now drove away almost all the lords and gentlemen from parliament, so there was nobody but the generals who had any power.

The wisest of the generals, Lord Essex, was dead. The next, General Fairfax, was a good man, but neither so clever nor so cunning as some of the others, particularly one whose name was Oliver Cromwell.

This Cromwell was a Puritan, or Roundhead. He was brave, and very sagacious, and very strictly[Pg 204] religious, according to his own notions, though some men thought him a hypocrite; at all events he was always thinking how he could make himself the greatest man in England.

He may have thought that, though the army had got King Charles in its power, the people would never allow him to be put in prison for his lifetime, and that, if he were sent away to another country, he might come back sometime and make war again. So he said that the king had behaved so ill that he ought to be tried before judges. And he and the other generals named a great many judges to examine into all the king’s actions and words.

In the meantime King Charles had been moved from one prison to another, till at last he was brought to London to be tried.

I cannot explain to you, my dear, all the hard and cruel things that were done to this poor king, whose greatest faults were owing to the bad education given him by his father, and the bad advice he got from his wife, and those men whom he thought his best friends.

When his misfortunes came, his wife escaped to France with a few of her own favourites; and her eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales, also escaped. Soon after his second son, James, Duke of York, also escaped to his mother; but the king’s daughter, Princess Elizabeth, and the little Henry, Duke of Gloucester, remained in England.

When King Charles was brought to London, only two of his own friends could see him every day: one of these was Dr. Juxon, Bishop of London, and the other was Mr. Herbert, his valet, who had been with him ever since the army had made him prisoner.

Shortly after the king was brought to London[Pg 205] the judges appointed by the army condemned him to death, and three days afterwards his head was cut off.

But those three days were the best and greatest of Charles’s life. In those he showed that, if he had been mistaken as a king, he was a good man and a right high-minded gentleman. One of these days you will read and know more about him. I will only tell you now about his taking leave of his children; and I will copy the very words of his valet, Mr. Herbert, who wrote down all that happened to his dear king and master, during the last part of his life.

The day after the king was condemned to die, “Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Gloucester, her brother, came to take their sad farewell of the king their father, and to ask his blessing. This was the twenty-ninth of January. The Princess, being the elder, was the most sensible of her royal father’s condition, as appeared by her sorrowful look and excessive weeping; and her little brother seeing his sister weep, he took the like impression, though, by reason of his tender age, he could not have the like apprehensions. The king raised them both from off their knees; he kissed them, gave them his blessing, and setting them on his knees, admonished them concerning their duty and loyal observance to the queen their mother, the prince that was his successor, love to the Duke of York and his other relations. The king then gave them all his jewels, save the George he wore, which was cut out in an onyx with great curiosity, and set about with twenty-one fair diamonds, and the reverse set with the like number; and again kissing his children, had such pretty and pertinent answers from them both, as drew tears of joy and love from his eyes; and then, praying God Almighty to bless them, he turned about, expressing[Pg 206] a tender and fatherly affection. Most sorrowful was this parting, the young princess shedding tears and crying lamentably, so as moved others to pity that formerly were hard-hearted; and at opening the chamber-door, the king returned hastily from the window and kissed them and blessed them.” So this poor little prince and princess never saw their father again.

As none of the people either in England, Scotland, or Ireland, had expected King Charles would be put to death, you may suppose, my dear little Arthur, how angry many of them were when they heard what had happened.

In Ireland the Roman Catholics knew they should be treated worse by the Puritans than they had been by the king’s governors; and the English settlers expected to be no better used than the old Irish; so they all made ready to fight against the army of the English parliament, if it should be sent to Ireland.

In Scotland, those who had sold King Charles to the English parliament were so angry with the English Roundheads for killing the king, that they[Pg 209] chose Prince Charles, the son of the poor dead king, for their king; and they got an army together to defend him and his friends.

As for England, the parliament (or rather the part of it that remained after the king’s death) chose a number of persons to govern the kingdom, and called them a council of state; and this council began to try to settle all those things quietly that had been disturbed by the sad civil war.

But the civil war in Ireland became so violent that the Council sent Oliver Cromwell, who was the best general in England, to that country; and he soon won a good many battles, and made great part of the country submit to the English. And he put his own soldiers into the towns, to keep them. As to the Irish who would have taken young King Charles’ part, and were Roman Catholics, he sent many of them abroad, and treated others so hardly that they were glad to get out of the country. So Cromwell made Ireland quiet by force, and left General Ireton to take care of it.

While Cromwell was in Ireland, a very brave Scotchman, whose name was James Graham, Marquis of Montrose, had gone to Scotland with soldiers from Germany and France, partly, as he said, to punish those who had allowed Charles the First to be beheaded, and partly to try to make Prince Charles king. This brave gentleman, whose story you will love to read some day, was taken prisoner by the Scotch army. The officers behaved very ill, for they forgot his bravery, and the kindness he had always shown to everybody when he was powerful. They forgot that he thought he was doing his duty in fighting for his king, and they put him to death very cruelly. They tied him to a cart, and dragged him disgracefully to[Pg 210] prison. They hanged him on a tall gallows, with a book, in which his life was written, tied to his neck; then they cut off his head and stuck it up over his prison-door.

About a month after the Scotch had disgraced themselves by that cruel action, young Prince Charles, whom they called Charles the Second, arrived in Scotland. But he found that he was treated more like a prisoner than a king. The lords and generals of the Scotch army wanted him to be a presbyterian like them; but he liked better to go with the Scotch army into England, to try and persuade the English to fight for him, and to make him king.

But Cromwell, who had returned from Ireland, collected a large army in England, with which he marched into Scotland; and, finding that Charles meant to make war in England, he followed him back again with part of the army, and left General Monk in Scotland with the rest.

Cromwell found King Charles and his army at Worcester, and there he fought and won a great battle, in which a great many Scotch noblemen were killed, as well as several English gentlemen. Charles was obliged to run away and hide himself, and for this time he gave up all hopes of being really King of England.

You would like, I daresay, to hear how he contrived to escape from Cromwell, who would certainly have shut him up in prison if he had caught him.

I must tell you that the English generals had promised a great deal of money to anybody who would catch Charles and bring him to them; and they threatened to hang anybody who helped the poor young prince in any way; but there were some brave[Pg 211] men and women too, who had pity on him, as you shall hear.

After the battle of Worcester, the first place he got to was a farm called Boscobel, where some poor wood-cutters, of the name of Penderell, took care of him, and gave him some of their own clothes to wear, that the soldiers might not find out that he was the prince. One evening he was obliged to climb up into an oak tree, and sit all night among the branches; it was well for him that the leaves were thick, for he heard some soldiers who were looking for him, say, as they passed under the tree, that they were sure he was somewhere thereabouts.

At that time his poor feet were so hurt with going without shoes, that he was obliged to get on horseback to move to another place, where the good wood-cutters still went with him. This time he was hidden by a lady, who called him her servant, and made him ride with her, in woman’s dress, to Bristol, where she was in hopes that she should find a ship to take him to France. But there was no ship ready to sail. Then he went to a Colonel Windham’s house, where the colonel, his mother, his wife, and four servants, all knew him; but not one told he was there. At last he got a vessel to take him at Shoreham, in Sussex, after he had been in more danger several times than I can tell you. He got safely to France, and did not come back to England for many years.

While Cromwell was following Charles to England, General Monk conquered the Scotch army, so that England, Scotland, and Ireland were all made obedient to the parliament about the time when the young king was driven out of the country.

[Pg 212]

But the parliament was obliged to attend to a war with the Dutch, who had behaved so very cruelly to some English people in India, that all England was eager to have them punished.

Accordingly the English and Dutch went to war, but they fought entirely on the sea. The Dutch had a very famous admiral named Tromp. The best English admiral was Blake; and these two brave men fought a great many battles. Tromp gained one or two victories; but Blake beat him often; and at last, on Tromp being killed, the Dutch were glad to make peace, and promised to punish all those persons who had behaved ill to the English in India, and to pay a great deal of money for the mischief they had done.

About four years after the death of King Charles I., the officers of the army thought themselves strong enough to govern the kingdom without the parliament; so one day Cromwell took a party of soldiers into the parliament-house, and turned everybody out, after abusing them heartily, and then locked up the doors. After this unlawful act, he soon contrived to get the people to call him the Protector of England, which was only another name for king; and from that time till his death he governed England as if he had been a lawful king.

Cromwell was very clever, and always chose the best generals and admirals, whenever he sent armies or fleets to fight. He knew how to find out the very best judges to take care of the laws, and the wisest and properest men to send to foreign countries, when messages for the good or the honour of England were required. He rewarded those who served the country well, but he spent very little money on himself or his family. He treated the children of[Pg 213] Charles that had not fled away to France with kindness. The little Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Gloucester were allowed to live together at Carisbrook; and a tutor and attendants were appointed to teach them and watch over them. The little princess soon died; and then the young Duke was sent to France to his mother, and money was given him to pay the expenses of his journey.

After Cromwell’s death his friends wished his son, Richard Cromwell, to be Protector of England. But Richard, who was a shy, quiet man, did[Pg 215] not like it, and after a very short trial went home to his house in the country, and left the people to do as they pleased about a Protector.

But the people were tired of being governed by the army, even under such a wise and clever man as Cromwell, and they chose to have a king and real parliament again.

Most men were glad to have bishops again, and to be allowed to have their own prayer-books and their own music in church, instead of being forced to listen for hours together to sermons from the Puritans, who called all pleasant things sin, and grudged even little children their play-hours.

But the really wise people of all kinds, the English Protestants, the Puritans, and the Roman Catholics, had another reason for being glad the king was come home. I will try to explain this reason. You have read that whenever there was any dispute about who should be king, there was always a war of some kind, and generally the worst of all, a civil war. Now, if the people had to choose who should be their new king every time an old one dies, so many men would wish to be king, that there would be disputes, and then perhaps war; and while the war was going on there would be nobody to see that the laws were obeyed, and all the mischief would happen that comes in civil wars.

Now in England, it is settled that when a king dies his eldest son shall be king next; or if he has no son, that his nearest relation shall be king or queen. You remember that after Edward the Sixth, his sisters, Mary and Elizabeth, were queens, and then their cousin, James Stuart, was king. This rule prevents all disputes, and keeps the kingdom quiet.

[Pg 216]

After Oliver Cromwell died, the wisest people were afraid there would be war before another protector could be chosen, so they agreed to have Charles, the son of Charles the First for their king, and to get him to promise not to break the laws, or to oppress the people; and they thought they would watch him, to prevent his doing wrong to the country, and they hoped he might have a son to be king quietly after him.

General Monk, who had the care of all Scotland in Cromwell’s time, was the person who contrived all the plans for bringing Charles the Second to England. It was done very quietly. An English fleet went to Scheveling, in Holland, where Charles got on board, and landed at Dover: in a very short time he arrived in London, along with General Monk, on his birth-day, the 29th of May, and England has never been without a king or queen since.

Charles was a merry, cheerful man, and very good natured. He was fond of balls, and plays, and masques, and nobody could have thought that England was the same place, who had seen it in Cromwell’s time. Then, people wore plain black or brown clothes, stiff starched cravats or small collars, their hair combed straight down, and they all looked as grave as if they were walking to a funeral.

But when Charles came, the ladies and gentlemen put on gay-coloured silk and satin coats; they wore ribbons and feathers, and long curly wigs, and danced and sang as if they were at a wedding.

However, while Charles and the young men were so gay, there were a few old wise lawyers, and clergymen, and admirals, and generals, who managed the laws and other business very well, although[Pg 217] there were a good many people who were sadly vexed to see a king again in England.
